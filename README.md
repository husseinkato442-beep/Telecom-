# Telecom Billing System

## Overview

This Java application simulates a simple telecom billing system. The system performs two key functions:

1. Charges **10% of the airtime** the user loads as a fee.
2. Charges **UGX 200 per second** for calls.

The program calculates and displays the **remaining balance** after a user:
- Loads **UGX 10,000** in airtime
- Makes a **5-minute call**

## Billing Rules

- **Airtime Loading Fee**: 10% of amount loaded
- **Call Rate**: UGX 200 per second
- **Call Duration**: 5 minutes (300 seconds)
